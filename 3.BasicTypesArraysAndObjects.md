# Type basics, arrays, and objects in TypeScript

## Type basics

The main difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is a system of types. Let’s define a variable just like shown below.
```
let firstName = 'Peter';
```
In TS variable `firstName` will be always a string and its type can’t be changed later in the code. The same goes for any other types of data like numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, etc. For example, if instead, with `‘Peter’` we will initialize the variable `firstName` with the numeric value we can then sign only numeric value to it in the latter code.

As you can see, the way we declare a variable is the same as in JavaScript. We do it with the keyword `let`, `const`, or `var`.

We can try now with a number and boolean. I have declared the variable called `age` and gave it a value of `30` and the variable `isOn` with `true` value.
```
let age = 30;
let isOn = true;
```

We can see that like I’ve mentioned above, the way of declaring variables looks the same as in JS.

*Worth mentioning that in TS and JS, we don’t use integers for whole numbers and floats for decimals. They are not two separate types like in other programming languages. We have a number type that covers both.*

If we try to override the value of the variable with another type of value then we will get an error like the one below.

We can change the values of variables but not types. Notice that we don’t have to say what type our variable should be. TypeScript uses something called `type inference`. It’s used when there is no explicit type annotation. If you would like to know more about it you can check the [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html). We also can explicitly define what type of variable will be.


## Functions

Let’s go to the topic of the functions. We can declare what type of variable we expect as an argument. In TS just like in JS you can use arrow syntax or a regular one. Let’s create the function to calculate an area of a circle.

```
const circleArea = radius => {
  return radius * radius * Math.PI;
}
```

*Math is a built-in object in JavaScript that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It’s not a function object, not the constructor. You can call Math as an object without creating it because the properties and methods of Math are static. TS is only extending JavaScript so you have access to all built-in methods and objects of JS.*

Let’s come back to the above function. Right now it’s possible to pass to it any type of value, even string or boolean. We can try to invoke circleArea with string as an argument and run it. Let’s console.log the result of that function below.
```
console.log(circleArea('nothing')); // result is NaN(Not a Number)
```

As you can see the result doesn’t give the user any errors. It’s compiling and runs even if the output is `NaN`. That’s exactly the type of problem that a system of types solves.
So how to define the type of argument that we expect to be passed into a function? Just like on the image below.

Instruction `radius: number` means that we can only pass a value that is a number, otherwise we will get an error just like the one seen in the picture. As you can see TypeScript can save us some time with looking for silly mistakes like the example above.

## Arrays And objects in TS

### Arrays

We declare arrays the same way we do it in JS. Check the image below.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kgv04vF1/2022-01-16-19-56.png">

Notice that we defined an array of strings so we can push only string value to it. When we try to push `39` or `true` editor underlines them and return errors. Also, we can’t override the value in an array with a different type of value.

When we declare new array the type that we assigned into that array cannot be changed later on. If you want to set type of an array but you don’t have any data to initialize it with than you can do it like shown here:
```
let friends: string[] = [];
```

Now you have an empty array that expect string values.

We can of course define arrays of mixed types. But worth remembering that if we declare an array with some types but some will be omitted then those who were omitted can’t be added to the array. So is the same rule like with variables. What you initialize with is what you can get. I try to visualize that in an example.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wBBGB8BM/2022-01-16-20-25.png">

As you can see we can add numbers and strings to our array because it’s been initialized with those types. Unfortunately, we can’t add boolean or any other type that we missed in initialization.

Typing works not only for elements of the array but also for an array itself. For example, if I want to change the value of a variable that has some array already assigned to it, I can’t do that. Look at the example below.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pXtcFndg/2022-01-16-20-34.png">

However, I can still change it on a different array with inner values of the same type. Anyway, it’s double secured. We know what types of values we can expect and also we can be sure that once an array it will stay an array for good.

### Objects

In objects, every property behaves the same way as variables. If we declare it with some value for example `‘string’`, we can only change it on another string.

Also like with arrays we can’t change the value of the variable with an object assigned to it on anything else than another object.

One more thing is that once we define an object we can’t add any additional properties to it. For example if I try in a code above add a property `contagiousness` I'll get an error. Please, look at the image below.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wvg3NVS1/2022-01-16-20-59.png">

Let’s assume I want to override the whole object. As I mentioned before I can’t do that with a different type of value so it has to be an object. Also, the structure of an object has to be the same as initialized. So I can change the values of properties but I can’t change properties names or even omit some of them or add new ones.

TypeScript is quite strict with different types but it’s a good thing because it means fewer errors and cleaner code.
